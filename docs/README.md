Source Files for Developer Documentation
========================================

The developer documentation uses Sphinx. Assuming you have Sphinx installed on
your system (Sphinx is a very common Python package that is available in most
package repos including Python's `pip`) building the documentation should be as
easy as running:

~~~
make html
~~~

in this directory. Then simply direct your web browser of choice to
`build/html/index.html` to view the documentation.

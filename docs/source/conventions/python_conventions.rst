Python Coding Conventions
*************************

This page tentatively introduces the NWX team's coding conventions for writing
Python.

.. All pull requests are expected to adhere to these conventions. 

Docstrings
==========

A general description of a docstring and standardized conventions are described
in `PEP-257 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`__. Docstrings in
NWChemEx are written using the ``Sphinx`` format, described
`here <https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html>`__.

VSCode Integration
------------------

Sphinx-style docstrings can be autogenerated for fully-defined functions/classes
in VSCode. Instructions can be found `here <https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.
readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html#docstrings-in-vs-code>`__.

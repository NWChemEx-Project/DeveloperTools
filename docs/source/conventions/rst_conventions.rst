******************************************
Conventions for Writing reST Documentation
******************************************

Style
=====

The style of reST pages follows Python's conventions. In particular:

- Follow the usual practice of at most 80 characters per line
- Indentation in reST is 3 spaces **NOT** 4

  - 3 spaces is natural for reST as this aligns with directives

Sections
========

NWChemEx adopts Python's reST conventions for denoting sections. Namely:

- ``#`` with overline should be used for parts
- ``*`` with overline is for chapters
- ``=`` for sections
- ``-`` for subsections
- ``^`` for subsubsections
